* Bug: Parens around unapplied infix op act no different to the infix
  op itself. Either get rid of them like before, or better yet: make
  them represent the after-arg position(?)

* Key to add redex

* Dapaot:
  * Add anim-id-remappings to sugar changes
  * Multi-ids

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab"
  in place of a DefinitionEdit

* ScrollBar

* From Nimrod: TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

For correctness:

* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Need replace/del to mark entire expression hierarchy now unreachable
  as invalidated for delete/modify conflicts
