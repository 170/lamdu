* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Lambda lacks sugar:
  * Lambda-inside-lambda -> Spaced params (currying)
  * Redex -> Where

* Remove definition parameters

* Delete of infix-right-arg goes to infix-left-arg, where it should go to func

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab"
  in place of a DefinitionEdit

* TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

* ScrollBar
