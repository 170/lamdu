* UserIO -> SizeDependentWidgetData ?

* FocusDelegator should not keep the eventmap of an unfocusable child
  when it isn't delegating (the "id" in the "maybe" call)

* Types should be an extra row in a grid. Not mess up the layout of the non-typed code

* makeParts should add the jumps in there..

* paramI/paramTypePtr to their own little tuple record
  * WhereItem should get a type under it too

* AncestryItem should contain parent ptr out-of-band???

* Extract Ancestry from Types

* Show type of lambda params

* Make where clauses parens boxes

* A Monad type for expression edit makers -- with hidden ReaderT for
  ancestry, and ExpressionEditMaker, and only allow recursing and
  passing prefixed ancestry when recursing

* Remove where bindings' folding

* Key to add redex

* Dapaot:
  * Add anim-id-remappings to sugar changes
  * Multi-ids

* Branch selection is buggy:

  We can create a discrepency between cursor pointing at one of the
  branches (e.g: after makeBranch) and the currentBranch property
  which updates the currentBranch and view!

* Types??

-------

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab"
  in place of a DefinitionEdit

* ScrollBar

* From Nimrod: TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

For correctness:

* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Need replace/del to mark entire expression hierarchy now unreachable
  as invalidated for delete/modify conflicts
