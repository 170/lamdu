* Allow editing built-ins

* Pure in-memory representation

  * Inferred types

* 1-use wheres to Sugar as "Titled Expressions"

* Space key to add params
  * Shared Clause for Where/Definition

* Associated comment for any expression to title it? Otherwise we're
  modifying the model to add a comment

* Dapaot:
  * Add anim-id-remappings to sugar changes
  * Multi-ids

-------

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab"
  in place of a DefinitionEdit

* ScrollBar

* From Nimrod: TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

For correctness:

* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Need replace/del to mark entire expression hierarchy now unreachable
  as invalidated for delete/modify conflicts
