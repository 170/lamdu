* "Enter: insert newline" is wrong (e.g: in LiteralInt edit)

* Jump back should be outside the source control. For this we need
  transactions inside the source control to be able to result in
  extra data outwards, beside the widget's event result.

* Oops, if type of left-hand-side is hole, then read-only holes at
   right should NOT have their scope based on their location (They are
   copies!)

   * In fact, maybe type annotations in general should not have all
   the surrounding values in scope? Is that too much free dependency?

   * Maybe read-only hole should not show results at all?

* ParamEdit needs to take the eventmap/actions of ExpressionEdit and
  also add them to the param via the FuncParam actions

* Widget framework:
  * Move "Cursor->" reader into widget

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab" in place of a DefinitionEdit

* 1-use wheres to Sugar as "Titled Expressions"

* Associated comment for any expression to title it? Otherwise we're
  modifying the model to add a comment

* Dapaot:
  * Add anim-id-remappings to sugar changes
  * Multi-ids

-------

* ScrollBar

* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Need replace/del to mark entire expression hierarchy now unreachable
  as invalidated for delete/modify conflicts
