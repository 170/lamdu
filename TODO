* Literals: bad inputs, zero

* HoleEdit: AnimId mapping for new param/def

* TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

* ScrollBar

* Cursor stack??
  * When going "up" the expression tree, there's no way to go back down (it loses your cursor)
