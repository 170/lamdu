* Make where clauses parens boxes

* Add remappings to sugars

* Key to add redex

* Branch selection is buggy:

  We can create a discrepency between cursor pointing at one of the
  branches (e.g: after makeBranch) and the currentBranch property
  which updates the currentBranch and view!

* Types??

-------

* Add JumpTo which gives a hole-like search -- that can sit in a "tab"
  in place of a DefinitionEdit

* ScrollBar

* From Nimrod: TextView returns all character position rects
  * TextEdit uses the character position rects to locate enter cursor

For correctness:

* Lambda unwrap invalidates params

* Need replace/del to mark entire expression hierarchy now unreachable
  as invalidated for delete/modify conflicts
