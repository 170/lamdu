This may be out of date, but I added it because why not :)

HoleEdit:

A hole edit is a complex widget, and is quite different when it
represents a Sugar.Hole with or without an "argument" (wrapper).

When Sugar.Arg doesn't exist in the Sugar.Hole, the HoleEdit is an
RegularHoleEdit, and can be Closed (cursor on SearchTerm parent
delegator) or Open (cursor on SearchTerm TextEdit or any result).

When the RegularHoleEdit is Open, the HoleEdit.Results widget hovers
below.

When Sugar.Arg does exist in the Sugar.Hole, the HoleEdit is a
WrapperHoleEdit, which is more complex than RegularHoleEdit, and has
multiple states, all of which use the wrapper's GUI size/alignment.

* Unfocused: Cursor outside hole, only the Wrapper is visible.

* Wrapper is focused: RegularHoleEdit hovers below.

* RegularHoleEdit is focused: The Wrapper hovers above.

Cursor Id's: The prefix cursor Id of all HoleEdit widget id's is the
Hole's entity id. Then, each widget inside has a different suffix:

Component           Suffix
Wrapper             ["wrapper"]
SearchTermFocusDel  ["regular", "closed"]
SearchTermTextEdit  ["regular", "open", "searchTermTextEdit"]
Results             ["regular", "open", "results"]

Results are shown iff the cursor is inside "open".

If a wrapper exists, the assignCursor of the hole's entity id is "wrapper".
Otherwise, it is ["regular", "open"].

HoleEdit chooses between creating a Wrapper hole or a RegularHole.
A RegularHole can be open or closed.
